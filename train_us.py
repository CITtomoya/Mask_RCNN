# # Mask R-CNN - Train on Shapes Dataset
# 
# 
# This notebook shows how to train Mask R-CNN on your own dataset. To keep things simple we use a synthetic dataset of shapes (squares, triangles, and circles) which enables fast training. You'd still need a GPU, though, because the network backbone is a Resnet101, which would be too slow to train on a CPU. On a GPU, you can start to get okay-ish results in a few minutes, and good results in less than an hour.
# 
# The code of the *Shapes* dataset is included below. It generates images on the fly, so it doesn't require downloading any data. And it can generate images of any size, so we pick a small image size to train faster.

# ## Training
# 
# Train in two stages:
# 1. Only the heads. Here we're freezing all the backbone layers and training only the randomly initialized layers (i.e. the ones that we didn't use pre-trained weights from MS COCO). To train only the head layers, pass `layers='heads'` to the `train()` function.
# 
# 2. Fine-tune all layers. For this simple example it's not necessary, but we're including it to show the process. Simply pass `layers="all` to train all layers.

# In[8]:


# Train the head branches
# Passing layers="heads" freezes all layers except the head
# layers. You can also pass a regular expression to select
# which layers to train by name pattern.
# model.train(dataset_train, dataset_val,
#             learning_rate=config.LEARNING_RATE,
#             epochs=2,
#             layers='heads')


# In[9]:


# Fine tune all layers
# Passing layers="all" trains all layers. You can also 
# pass a regular expression to select which layers to
# train by name pattern.

# Save weights
# Typically not needed because callbacks save after every epoch
# Uncomment to save manually
